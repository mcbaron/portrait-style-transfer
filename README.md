# style-transfer-survey

## Survey of Image Style Transfer Methodologies


The proposed project is an examination of different methods for image style transfer, from a linear algebraic construction through automatic and convolutional neural networks. Hopefully to understand what patterns and features a machine can learn that underlie human image perception.
